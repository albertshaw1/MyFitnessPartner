# MyFitnessPartner
This app was my final year project, which I created using React Native, Node.js, and MySQL. The Gym app consists of three modules: trainer, trainee, and gym. Trainers can register in any gym and their details are stored in the database. Trainee users can view the fees of trainers in different gyms and subscribe to any trainer in any gym.
